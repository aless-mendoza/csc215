## Logic
### :sparkles: *The Mathematical Analysis of Logic* by George Boole :sparkles:<br>
- showed how logic can be analyzed using simple arithmatic<br>
- All practical digital computers and many other electrical circuits are based on these concepts
<br><br>

### $${\color{blue}Boolean \space Algebra}$$<br>
Boolean expressions are the expressions that evaluate a condition and result in a Boolean value<br>
A logic statement is either **true** :thumbsup: or **false** :thumbsdown: <br>
- there are no maybes :x: :x:
<br><br>

### Basic Logic
- $${\color{green}AND}$$

|  A  |  B  |  Output  |
|-----|-----|----------|
|  1  |  1  |    1     |
|  1  |  0  |    0     |
|  0  |  1  |    0     |
|  0  |  0  |    0     |

- $${\color{yellow}OR}$$ 

|  A  |  B  |  Output  |
|-----|-----|----------|
|  1  |  1  |    1     |
|  1  |  0  |    1     |                 
|  0  |  1  |    1     |
|  0  |  0  |    0     |

- $${\color{red}NOT}$$  

|  A  |  Output  |
|-----|----------|
|  1  |    0     |
|  0  |    1     |
