# CPM Assembly Language - Preface and Introduction

## Preface
- Assembly language is prevalent in many areas
    - It is known for its compactness and fast execution speed
    - Unlike languages that resemble plain English, assembly requires you to think in terms of the machine
    - To write in assembly, you must understand the machine's architecture, learn its instruction set, and work within its size and computational limits
- The Control Program for Microcomputers (CP/M) has made learning assembly easier
    - Assembly languages became portable, meaning they are no longer tied to specific hardware
    - Regardless of the computer's brand or model, programmers can operate in a consistent environment
    - CP/M standardizes the experience across different computers
    - You can safely experiment with a CP/M-based computer from the operator's console without fear of causing harm

## Introduction
- The keys you press will appear in bold
    - All other characters are output by CP/M
    - `cr` indicates when you press the return key
- Mnemonics help make assembly code more readable
- You enter a source program into a disk file using CP/M's ED.COM, then assemble it with ASM.COM
    - Using the editor and assembler is the most reliable way to create programs with minimal errors
- Assembly is ideal for direct interaction with hardware
- Assembly is especially valuable for:
    - Programs where minimizing size is crucial
    - Situations where execution speed is critical
- What you'll need:
    - This book
    - A computer that runs CP/M
        - The manual for your CP/M operating system
    - A complete copy of the CP/M system disk
        - Set aside a blank disk specifically for your exercises
    - The "8080/8085 Assembly Language Programming Manual," publication number 98-940
