## Running the program

### The text book gives the following code;

A> **DDTcr**
DDT VERS 1.4
-**S100cr**
0100 01 **0Ecr**
0101 B6 **02cr**
0102 OF **1Ecr**
0103 C3 **24cr**
0104 3D **CDcr**
0105 01 **05cr**
0106 43 **00cr**
0107 4F **C3cr**
0108 50 **00cr**
0109 59 **00cr**
010A 52 **.cr**
-**G100cr**
$
A>

- When inputing this into your terminal, know that "cr" means return. So, when typing this in you press the "return" key on your computer instead
- The output is the "$"

### This is what it should look like from a school computer terminal
